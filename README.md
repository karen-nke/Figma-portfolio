During my internship with Swipey, I took on the exciting challenge of revamping their entire company website using Wordpress. Over the course of 3 months, I develop a visually appealing design that aimed to captivate and engage the target audience using Wordpress. The website is will accessible [here](https://www.swipey.co).

The Figma file showcasing the screenshots of the website can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/4nHvYrA1kW2JqfzXV3XybS/Swipey-Website?type=design&mode=design&t=KPRByA69tpcDiyBh-1).

In a tight timeframe of just 1 day, I designed an eye-catching landing page for Plantenesis, an innovative agriculture startup. The goal was to convey the essence of the company's mission and values through a compelling visual narrative.

As a passion project, I conceptualized and developed the prototype for HyPay, a mobile payment application. This project allowed me to delve into the realm of user experience and interface design, creating a seamless and intuitive payment experience.

For the HyPay brand, I extended the design process to their website, aiming to establish a cohesive and visually striking online presence. This project allowed me to showcase the brand's identity and services in an engaging and user-friendly manner.
